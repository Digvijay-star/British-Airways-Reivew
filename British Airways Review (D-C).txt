
Project Title: British Airways Customer Review Analysis

Description:
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer reviews for British Airways to assess overall passenger satisfaction and identify areas needing improvement. The dataset comprised detailed reviews from various customers across different routes, aircraft types, and traveler categories. Key metrics such as seat comfort, cabin staff service, food quality, ground service, value for money, and entertainment were evaluated.

The analysis revealed significant dissatisfaction among customers, particularly in the economy and business class segments. Common complaints included mediocre service, declining standards, and issues with the reliability of flights. By analyzing trends in the data, I provided actionable insights that could help British Airways improve customer satisfaction and enhance their overall service quality.

Conclusion:
The project underscored the importance of continuous monitoring of customer feedback to maintain high service standards in the airline industry. The findings suggested that British Airways needs to address specific pain points such as improving seat comfort, enhancing ground services, and ensuring better value for money. Implementing these changes could lead to improved customer satisfaction, potentially reversing the trend of negative reviews.

This analysis not only provided a snapshot of current customer sentiment but also highlighted critical areas for improvement, paving the way for more targeted and effective service enhancements.
